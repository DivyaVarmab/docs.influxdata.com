The rolling online upgrade process for InfluxDB Enterprise provides minimal downtime (ideally zero). During this process, upgrade and restart one node at a time while other nodes continue to operate online. With a few exceptions, the cluster continues to works as though it were on the earlier version until all of the nodes are upgraded.

### Back up the data

Before upgrading your InfluxDB Enterprise cluster, back up your data, logs, and custom configurations.

* Full database backups include server metadata (users, authorizations, and data).
* Copy logs and configurations
  * logs
    * influxdb.log
    * HTTP log (if redirected)
  * configurations
    * influxdb.conf
    * influxdb-meta.conf
    * environment variables


## Rolling online upgrades

### Step 1: Stop influxd service

### Step 2: Delete _series directories

### Step 3: Delete index directories

### Step 4: Rebuild TSI indexes

### Step 5: Restart influxd service


## Offline upgrades

1. Stop influx services on all nodes.
2. ...
3. ...
4. ...
5. Restart ...


## Upgrading InfluxDB Enterprise 1.3.x-1.7.x clusters to 1.7.4 (rolling upgrade)

InfluxData recommends upgrading your Enterprise cluster using the following "rolling upgrade" approach.
Rolling upgrades are performed on live systems, prevent the need for downtime, and mimimize the impact on users.

### Step 0: Back up your cluster before upgrading to version 1.7.4

Create a full backup of your InfluxDB Enterprise cluster before performing an upgrade.
If you have incremental backups created as part of your standard operating procedures, make sure to
trigger a final incremental backup before proceeding with the upgrade.

> ***Note:*** For information on performing a final incremental backup or a full backup,
> see [Backing up and restoring in InfluxDB Enterprise](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.7/administration/backup-and-restore/).

## Upgrading meta nodes

Follow these steps to upgrade all meta nodes in your InfluxDB Enterprise cluster. Ensure that the meta cluster is healthy before proceeding to the data nodes.


### Step 1: Install the 1.7.4 meta nodes package

### Step 2: Restart the `influxdb-meta` service

#### Meta node restart

##### sysvinit systems

```bash
service influxdb-meta restart
```

##### systemd systems

```bash
sudo systemctl restart influxdb-meta
```

### Step 4: Confirm the upgrade

After performing the upgrade on ALL meta nodes, check your node version numbers using the
`influxd-ctl show` command.
The [`influxd-ctl` utility](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.7/administration/cluster-commands/) is available on all meta nodes.

```bash
~# influxd-ctl show

Data Nodes
==========
ID	TCP Address		Version
4	rk-upgrading-01:8088	1.6.x_c1.6.y
5	rk-upgrading-02:8088	1.6.x_c1.6.y
6	rk-upgrading-03:8088	1.6.x_c1.6.y

Meta Nodes
==========
TCP Address		Version
rk-upgrading-01:8091	1.7.4_c1.7.4   # 1.7.4_c1.7.4 = üëç
rk-upgrading-02:8091	1.7.4_c1.7.4
rk-upgrading-03:8091	1.7.4_c1.7.4
```

## Upgrading data nodes

Repeat the following steps for each data node in your InfluxDB Enterprise cluster.

### Step 1: Download the 1.7.4 data node package

#### Data node package download

##### Ubuntu and Debian (64-bit)

```bash
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data_1.7.4-c1.7.4_amd64.deb
```

##### RedHat and CentOS (64-bit)

```bash
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data-1.7.4_c1.7.4.x86_64.rpm
```

### Step 2: Remove the data node from the load balancer

To avoid downtime and allow for a smooth transition, remove the data node you are upgrading from your load balancer **before** performing the remaining steps.

### Step 3: Remove all `_series` directories



### Step 4: Install the 1.7.4 data node packages

#### Data node package install

When you run the install command, your terminal asks if you want to keep your
current configuration file or overwrite your current configuration file with the file for version 1.7.4.

Keep your current configuration file by entering `N` or `O`.
The configuration file will be updated with the necessary changes for version 1.7.4 in the next step.

##### Ubuntu and Debian (64-bit)

```bash
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-data_1.7.4-c1.7.4_amd64.deb
```

##### RedHat and CentOS (64-bit)

```bash
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-data-1.7.4_c1.7.4.x86_64.rpm
```

### Step 5: Update the data node configuration file

> The first official Time Series Index (TSI) was released with InfluxDB v1.5.
> Although you can install without enabling TSI, you are encouraged to begin leveraging the advantages the TSI disk-based indexing offers.

**Add:**

* If enabling TSI: [index-version = "tsi1"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.7/administration/config-data-nodes#index-version-inmem) to the `[data]` section.
* If not enabling TSI: [index-version = "inmem"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.7/administration/config-data-nodes#index-version-inmem) to the `[data]` section.
  - Use 'tsi1' for the Time Series Index (TSI); set the value to `inmem` to use the TSM in-memory index.
* [wal-fsync-delay = "0s"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.7/administration/config-data-nodes#wal-fsync-delay-0s) to the `[data]` section
* [max-concurrent-compactions = 0](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.7/administration/config-data-nodes#max-concurrent-compactions-0) to the `[data]` section
* [pool-max-idle-streams = 100](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.7/administration/config-data-nodes#pool-max-idle-streams-100) to the `[cluster]` section
* [pool-max-idle-time = "1m0s"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.7/administration/config-data-nodes#pool-max-idle-time-60s) to the `[cluster]` section
* the [[anti-entropy]](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.7/administration/config-data-nodes#anti-entropy) section:

```
[anti-entropy]
  enabled = true
  check-interval = "30s"
  max-fetch = 10
```

**Remove:**

* `max-remote-write-connections` from the `[cluster]` section
* `[admin]` section

**Update:**

* [cache-max-memory-size](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.7/administration/config-data-nodes#cache-max-memory-size-1g) to `1073741824` in the `[data]` section

The new configuration options are set to the default settings.

### Step 6: [For TSI Preview instances only] Prepare the dataa node to support Time Series Index (TSI).

1. Delete all existing TSM-based shard `index` directories.

- Remove the existing `index` directories to ensure there are no incompatible index files.
- By default, the `index` directories are located at `/<shard_ID>/index` (e.g., `/2/index`).

2. Convert existing TSM-based shards (or rebuild TSI Preview shards) to support TSI.

  - When TSI is enabled, new shards use the TSI disk-based indexing. Existing shards must be converted to support TSI.
  - Run the [`influx_inspect buildtsi`](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/influx_inspect#buildtsi) command to convert existing TSM-based shards (or rebuild TSI Preview shards) to support TSI.

> **Note:** Run the `buildtsi` command using the user account that you are going to run the database as,
> or ensure that the permissions match afterward.

### Step 6: Restart the `influxdb` service

#### Restart data node

##### sysvinit systems

```bash
service influxdb restart
```

##### systemd systems

```bash
sudo systemctl restart influxdb
```

### Step 7: Add the data node back into the load balancer.

Add the data node back into the load balancer to allow it to serve reads and writes.

If this is the last data node to be upgraded, proceed to step 7.
Otherwise, return to Step 1 of [Upgrading data nodes](#upgrading-data-nodes) and repeat the process for the remaining data nodes.

### Step 8: Confirm the upgrade

Your cluster is now upgraded to InfluxDB Enterprise 1.7.4.
Check your node version numbers using the `influxd-ctl show` command.
The [`influxd-ctl`](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.7/administration/cluster-commands/) utility is available on all meta nodes.

```bash
~# influxd-ctl show

Data Nodes
==========
ID	TCP Address		Version
4	rk-upgrading-01:8088	1.7.4_c1.7.4   # 1.7.4_c1.7.4 = üëç
5	rk-upgrading-02:8088	1.7.4_c1.7.4
6	rk-upgrading-03:8088	1.7.4_c1.7.4

Meta Nodes
==========
TCP Address		Version
rk-upgrading-01:8091	1.7.4_c1.7.4
rk-upgrading-02:8091	1.7.4_c1.7.4
rk-upgrading-03:8091	1.7.4_c1.7.4
```
